An end-to-end real-time Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system built for NVIDIA Jetson devices. This project uses YOLOv8 for detecting license plates and PaddleOCR for reading text from the plates. Uses IPCam on mobile to use the camera instead of an actual camera, can switch to usb camera for better quality.
